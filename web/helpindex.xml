    <h1>Welcome to NLog</h1>
    <p>
        NLog is a free logging platform for .NET with rich log routing and management 
        capabilities. It makes it easy to produce and manage high-quality logs 
        for your application regardless of its size or complexity.
    </p>
    <p>
        It can process diagnostic messages emitted from any .NET language, augment
        them with contextual information, format them according to your preference 
        and send them to one or more targets such as file or database. 
        .NET, C/C++ and COM interop APIs are supported so that all your application components 
        including legacy modules written in C++/COM can route their log messages through a 
        common engine.
