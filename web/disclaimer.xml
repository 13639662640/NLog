       My name is Jaroslaw Kowalski and I am the author and primary maintainer of NLog. 
       I am currently employed by Microsoft Corporation. NLog is my personal project which I started in 2004. I joined Microsoft Corporation in 2006 
       after releasing NLog v1.0 and am continuing to maintain the project in my free time as a service to the community.

       NLog is my sole responsibility. NLog is not affiliated nor endorsed by Microsoft Corporation or any of my previous employers. 
       Microsoft Corporation does not provide any kind of support for NLog.
